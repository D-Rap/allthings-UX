### BXT - Business viability + eXperiance desirability + Technical feasibility

## Investigaing Use Needs
<details>
 <summary>Qualitative Research Techniques</summary>
Asking customers what they need is not an accurate way to reflect on what need to be done as people cannot accurately recounting their personal experience. Their experience is also depending on their frame of reference. 
<ol> 
 <li> User Interviews </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Result: user's attitude
  </ul>
<li>  Contextual Inquiry </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Best used in the discovery phase</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Important to document of he distractions on the user's environment as they influnce the design solution</li>
    <li> Benefit from higher number of participants</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Result: Behavioral, Social, environmental and attitudinal data</li>
   </ul>
<li>  Stakeholder Interview </li>
  <ul>
  <li>To establish the needs and beliefs of your business partners</li>
  <li>Business requirement - performance against specific business metrics</li>
  <li> Result: Collect business requirements, key performance indicators/attributes of a succesful design</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
 <li>Result: Collect metrics for success as well as beliefs about success</li>
  </ul>
<li>  Focus Group </li>
  <ul>
 <li>Common for branding and visual finishing phase of a project</li>
 <li>Result: Beliefs, attitudes and subjective preferences, however, at risk of collecting no useful data without expert moderation</li>
  </ul>
<li>  Usability Testing </li>
  <ul>
 <li>Run a user interactive design experience against other prototype (e.g. previous version, competitor's version) is a very accurate was to observe user's habits and practises</li>
 <li>Result: Proven user bahviour</li>
   </ul>
   </ol>

 <summary>What to consider during a data gathering process </summary>
 <ol>
  <li> Make participants feel comfortable </li>
  <ol>
 <li> Respect their boundries </li>
   <ul>
  <li> They can end the session any time</li>
  <li> They can pass on questions</li>
  <li> Stick to the schedule</li>
  <li> They are hydrated and physically at ease</li>
  <li> There is no wrong answer as the purpose of the session is to understand their beliefs</li>
    </ul>
 <li> Don't correct or judge</li>
   <ul>
  <li>Corrections will change the dynamic of the conversation</li>
    </ul>
 <li> Don't explain things to them unless they've asked for explanation</li>
   <ul>
  <li>and then only after responding to the initial request with "what do you believe the right answer should be?"</li>
  <li>Any explanation will change the dynamic of the conversation and shut down the flow of necessary data from them to you</li>
    </ul>
 </ol>
<li> Listen actively</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Probe for clarification when you don't understand something they've said or done</li>
 <li> Do not make assumptions about their intent: ask them</li>
  </ol>
<li> Avoid leading questions</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Check all of your questions for hidden assumptions in the way they are framed</li>
   <ul>
  <li>Questions that lead with "when did you stop…" or "don't you think…", or even "do you believe…" are encoding an implicit assumption that the user started or thought something</li>
  <li>Questions which end with "you agree, right?" are forcing the user to evaluate and accept a conclusion they did not arrive at themselves</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
<li> Avoid dead end questions unless you need to move on to another research topic</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Dead end questions are generally answerable with a single fact. Yes, no, date, or number are appropriate answers for dead end questions</li>
 <li> Only use them when you've gathered enough information on the current topic and you want to change the topic</li>
   </ol>
<li> Avoid compound questions</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Difficult to know which part of the question the user responded to</li>
 <li>Beware of questions that contain a pivotal "or" in the middle, as you're limiting the possibilities and requiring an answer that is more complex</li>
   </ol>
<li> Take copious notes</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Become adept at rapid note taking in a non-obtrusive way</li>
   <ul>
  <li>Many researchers gain consent to create an audio recording so they can review the session later and codify their insights and observations</li>
  <li>If you have a colleague willing to help, you could take a note taker along on the research session</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</ol>

<details>
 <summary>Quantitative Research Techniques</summary>
Gather any quantitative data that can measure the performance of an existing design or reaction to a fixed stimulus 
<ol> 
 <li> Customer Support issues tracking </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Support issues arising from user confusion are issues which user experience design can prevent </li>
  </ul>
<li>  Instrumentation </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Most modern services and applications have some way of tracking what workflows the user is using. </li>
    <ul>
    <li>This data can be aggregated into Sankey diagrams or other visuals to indicate how users are using the software</li>
    </ul>
<li>  Surveys </li>
   <ul>
    <li>Surveys will almost never teach you something new about user intent; instead they are excellent tools for confirming or refuting a hypothesis</li>
   </ul>

 <summary>Investigating Existing Solutions</summary>
 You can evaluate everything from business model, target markets, features provided, layouts, to interaction styles. The more you are informed about previous success and failures in solving the problem you're working to solve, the more likely you are to make a solution that exceeds what's gone before.
