### Needfinding - Finding exactly what the target user needs

### BXT - Business viability + eXperiance desirability + Technical feasibility

## Investigaing Use Needs
<details>
 <summary>Qualitative Research Techniques</summary>
 <br>
Asking customers what they need is not an accurate way to reflect on what need to be done as people cannot accurately recounting their personal experience. Their experience is also depending on their frame of reference. 
<ol> 
 <li> User Interviews </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Result: user's attitude
  </ul>
<li>  Contextual Inquiry </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Best used in the discovery phase</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Important to document of he distractions on the user's environment as they influnce the design solution</li>
    <li> Benefit from higher number of participants</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Result: Behavioral, Social, environmental and attitudinal data</li>
   </ul>
<li>  Stakeholder Interview </li>
  <ul>
  <li>To establish the needs and beliefs of your business partners</li>
  <li>Business requirement - performance against specific business metrics</li>
  <li> Result: Collect business requirements, key performance indicators/attributes of a succesful design</li>
  </ul>
<li>  Customer Interview </li>
  <ul>
 <li>Result: Collect metrics for success as well as beliefs about success</li>
  </ul>
<li>  Focus Group </li>
  <ul>
 <li>Common for branding and visual finishing phase of a project</li>
 <li>Result: Beliefs, attitudes and subjective preferences, however, at risk of collecting no useful data without expert moderation</li>
  </ul>
<li>  Usability Testing </li>
  <ul>
 <li>Run a user interactive design experience against other prototype (e.g. previous version, competitor's version) is a very accurate was to observe user's habits and practises</li>
 <li>Result: Proven user bahviour</li>
   </ul>
   </ol>
 </details>
 
<details>
 <summary>What to consider during a data gathering process </summary>
 <br>
 <ol>
  <li> Make participants feel comfortable </li>
  <ol>
 <li> Respect their boundries </li>
   <ul>
  <li> They can end the session any time</li>
  <li> They can pass on questions</li>
  <li> Stick to the schedule</li>
  <li> They are hydrated and physically at ease</li>
  <li> There is no wrong answer as the purpose of the session is to understand their beliefs</li>
    </ul>
 <li> Don't correct or judge</li>
   <ul>
  <li>Corrections will change the dynamic of the conversation</li>
    </ul>
 <li> Don't explain things to them unless they've asked for explanation</li>
   <ul>
  <li>and then only after responding to the initial request with "what do you believe the right answer should be?"</li>
  <li>Any explanation will change the dynamic of the conversation and shut down the flow of necessary data from them to you</li>
    </ul>
 </ol>
<li> Listen actively</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Probe for clarification when you don't understand something they've said or done</li>
 <li> Do not make assumptions about their intent: ask them</li>
  </ol>
<li> Avoid leading questions</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Check all of your questions for hidden assumptions in the way they are framed</li>
   <ul>
  <li>Questions that lead with "when did you stop…" or "don't you think…", or even "do you believe…" are encoding an implicit assumption that the user started or thought something</li>
  <li>Questions which end with "you agree, right?" are forcing the user to evaluate and accept a conclusion they did not arrive at themselves</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
<li> Avoid dead end questions unless you need to move on to another research topic</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Dead end questions are generally answerable with a single fact. Yes, no, date, or number are appropriate answers for dead end questions</li>
 <li> Only use them when you've gathered enough information on the current topic and you want to change the topic</li>
   </ol>
<li> Avoid compound questions</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Difficult to know which part of the question the user responded to</li>
 <li>Beware of questions that contain a pivotal "or" in the middle, as you're limiting the possibilities and requiring an answer that is more complex</li>
   </ol>
<li> Take copious notes</li>
  <ol>
 <li> Become adept at rapid note taking in a non-obtrusive way</li>
   <ul>
  <li>Many researchers gain consent to create an audio recording so they can review the session later and codify their insights and observations</li>
  <li>If you have a colleague willing to help, you could take a note taker along on the research session</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</ol>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Quantitative Research Techniques</summary>
 <br>
Gather any quantitative data that can measure the performance of an existing design or reaction to a fixed stimulus 
<ol> 
 <li> Customer Support issues tracking </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Support issues arising from user confusion are issues which user experience design can prevent </li>
  </ul>
<li>  Instrumentation </li>
  <ul>
  <li> Most modern services and applications have some way of tracking what workflows the user is using. </li>
    <ul>
    <li>This data can be aggregated into Sankey diagrams or other visuals to indicate how users are using the software</li>
    </ul>
<li>  Surveys </li>
   <ul>
    <li>Surveys will almost never teach you something new about user intent; instead they are excellent tools for confirming or refuting a hypothesis</li>
   </ul>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Investigating Existing Solutions</summary>
 <br>
 You can evaluate everything from business model, target markets, features provided, layouts, to interaction styles. The more you are informed about previous success and failures in solving the problem you're working to solve, the more likely you are to make a solution that exceeds what's gone before.
 </details>
 
  ## Unpacking your Research
<details>
 <summary>Affinity Diagrams</summary>
 <br>
 Affinity diagram helps a group identify trends and gaps from a large qualitative data set.
 <br>
 Things to consier
 <ol>
  <li> Clarify which note was from which participant</li>
  <li> Reach a group a greement about the note if the research was conduct by a group</li>
  <li> The note taken from the research should either be a direct quote from the participant or an insight gained by the research team</li>
  <li> Do not add design ideas to the affinity diagram </li>
  <li> Note about progress should be in a sequence diagram not affinility diagram</li>
  <li> A successful affinity diagramming session will include stakeholders and other team members after the initial research was conducted </li>
  <li> Once the notes are gathered, distribute them among the team member and sort them into groups base on the insights yielded from the notes. (Do this in silent) If any groups seem redundant, move the notes into groups that are discrete.</li>
  <li> If a group contains insight from only one user, consider moving those notes into different headings.</li>
  <li> If a group contains less than 3 notes, either conduct more research, find other supporting group or take it as a weak insight</li>
  <li> If a group contains more than a dozen notes, see if it can be broken down further</li>
  <li> The digram is done when every participants feel a note needs not to be moved again</li>
  <li> In large affinity diagrams it may be worth while to create a level of descriptive grouping above the headings you just created</li>
 </ol>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Sequence Diagrams </summary>
 <ul>
  <li> A step-by-step record of the way multiple users interact with an information system</li>
  <li> They should show trigger conditions, user intent, and every step the user took to fulfill teir goall </li>
  <li> It is important to call out the breakdowns. What stop user from continuing the workflow </li>
 </ul>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Charts</summary>
 <ul>
  <li> Charts allow us to convey significant amounts of data in a compact representation </li>
  <li> Very useful when reporting on quantitative information</li>
 </ul>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Customer Journey Maps</summary>
 <ul>
  <li>Map the customer's journey at every response points, sometimes referred to as "moments of truth"</li>
  <li>These visualizations will lead to insights in ways organizations can be over communicating, under-communicating, and sometimes giving customers contradictory information</li>
  </ul>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summaryPersonas</summary>
 <ul>
  <li>Craft a portrait of a user based on marketing research details</li>
  <li>The problem with personas is that they can be an image built up by the disigner and does not accurately represent a real user</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Market Segments</summary>
 <ul>
  <li>A market segment is a group of people or organizations that share one or more characteristics, causing them to have similar product or service needs</li>
  </ul>
 </details>
 
  <details>
 <summary>Behavioral Segments</summary>
 <ul>
  <li>Grouping users by commonality of how the user behaves</li>
  </ul>
 </details>
 
  <details>
 <summary>Universal Tips</summary>
 <br>
 Regardless of which user modelling approach you take, user modeling needs to be a part of a software design process. The successful user modeling approach will have the following attributes
 <ol>
  <li>It will help an engineering team empathize with another human</li>
  <li>It will provide sufficient context to avoid context mismatch problems like the 1971 Soyuz re-entry capsule</li>
  <li>It will provide insight into the attitudes and behaviors of the target users</li>
  <li>It will prove useful in making design decisions by its ability to represent an in-elastic user of the system. Ideally it has enough muscle to win a disagreement with the highest paid person's opinion</li>
  <li>It can be used to recruit for usability research</li>
  <li>It is kept alive through the engineering process to ensure the product is built with a focus on the user's point of view</li>
  </ol>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Generating Insights</summary>
 <ul>
  <li>Once a personas is detailed, it is important to outline what success would look like instead of how to get there</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Scenarios</summary>
 <br>
 Valid scenarios have the following seven attributes
 <ol>
  <li>Story. Good scenarios utilise storytelling techniques in order to engender empathy for the user in the reader. They have a beginning, middle, and end. There is a protagonist. There is a trigger event which generates tension, and there is a resolution. They are prose.</li>
  <li>Personal Details. Good scenarios bring forward insights into the user's context and goals from your primary research.</li>
  <li>Implementation-free. Good scenarios do not prescribe the solution to the challenge the user has; solution design is left for a later phase. The purpose of the scenario is to encapsulate the research you've done into a short paragraph which describes the user, the user's goals, the user's context, and a specific challenge or unmet need the user is experiencing, then describes the desired outcome in user centered terms. </li>
  <li>Customer's Story: The scenario is a story about the customer, not about the product you're going to build.</li>
  <li>Insight. A good scenario will give the reader insight into the customer's needs, context, and goals.</li>
  <li>Emotions and Environment. A good scenario includes emotions and environment; both in the description of the current state and the description of the desired outcome.</li>
  <li>Research. Good scenarios are grounded in all the research that has come before this phase. Good scenarios are not based on assumptions, hearsay, or biased viewpoints.</li>
 </ol>
 Suggested template for creating scenarios
 <ul>
  <li>One Line Headline - Useful to distinguish this scenario from other scenarios when you're looking at a list of them. This phrase will be used a lot, so it pays to make it catchy and memorable.</li>
  <li>Introduction - Who is the user? What motivates them? This should provide sufficient data to recruit participants for usability studies later. If you've defined the user as a persona, referring to the persona name is sufficient here as long as the detail is in the persona. In addition, the user's current emotional state can be useful to include here.</li>
  <li>Situation - What is the specific, real world situation where there is a need or an opportunity? Call out the key constraints of what a good solution would need to address.</li>
  <li><magic happens> - This phrase will help you stay out of the details of what you're going to build. Adding in implementation details at this phase will prevent you from finding the best solution during the design process.</li>
  <li>Outcomes - What specific outcomes has the user accomplished? What are the key metrics for success? You can use these metrics in usability studies to determine if your solution is working or not.</li>
 </ul>
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Experience Outcomes</summary>
 Three components of the Experiance outcomes
 <ol>
  <li>Direction. How do you want to move the measure?</li>
  <li>Unit of Measure. How do we determine when the solution is good enough to ship?</li>
  <li>Outcome. Something the product must do well to be successful; supported by evidence.</li>
 </ol>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>User Stories</summary>
 <br>
 The general construct of a user story is: As a <role>, I want <goal/task>, so that <benefit>. Mature practitioners also include a definition of done so that the engineering team knows when the solution meets the acceptance criteria.
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Use Cases</summary>
<ul>
 <li>A specific situation in which a product or service could potentially be used</li>
<li>Complete use cases include a title, a primary actor, a goal in context, a scope, a level, a list of stakeholders and interests, a precondition, minimal guarantees, success guarantees, a trigger, main success scenario, extensions, technology and data variations</li>
<li>Engineering efforts based on use cases alone can produce disconnected interactions which didn't consider user goals or context in completing a task</li>
</ul>
 </details>
 
 ## Prototype
 ### Brainstorming
 <details>
 <summary>Predict Tunnel Vision</summary>
 <br>
 When a design team is attempting to create a solution to a problem, it is of utmost importance that the field of possible solutions is broad. At this stage of the design effort, we need to force ourselves to generate as many solutions as the time allows. From that field of ideas, a synthesis of the best aspects of many ideas might form our hypotheses about the solution we'll eventually build. Our minds are used to optimizing, and we're generally more comfortable building on things we already know. The difficulty with optimizing on what you already know is that you might become blind to an alternative that performs much better.
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Brainstorming Rules</summary>
 <ol>
  <li>Common understanding of the problem space you're trying to solve. Focus the session on brainstorming the <magic happens> portion of one scenario, or methods of achieving one experience outcome.</li>
  <li>Go for quantity. Moving quickly suppresses the tendency to exercise judgement and control. This prohibits vertical thinking from taking over. Setting a goal of coming up with ten ideas in a ten minutes will help make this shift.</li>
  <li>Defer judgement. Judgement is vertical thinking. To engage our lateral thinking capability, we give the team permission to not judge any idea during the brainstorming session.</li>
  <li>Build on the ideas of others ("yes, and…" instead of "no, but…"). Listen to and build on the ideas of others. The randomizing input of your teammates can help spur new ways of solving a problem. Don't criticize any idea at this point, since that has the effect of shutting down the creative/lateral thinking pathways which may hint at new solutions.</li>
  <li>Encourage wild ideas. Even if an idea seems nonsensical, accept the idea as a foundation for the next idea you generate. Even jokes can help engage the lateral thinking part of our brain. The idea that comes after the wild one might be an interesting way of solving the problem.</li>
 </ol>
 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Lateral Thinking</summary>
 <br>
 When a team is stuck for new ideas, there are several techniques which might prove useful. These techniques are messy. They are the least efficient, most chaotic way of solving a problem, however in the next phase of design these inefficient chaotic practices might generate foundational ideas for new approaches to solving any problem.
 <ul>
  <li>Look at another domain</li>
  <li>Use analogy</li>
  <li>Reversal</li>
  <li>Random input</li>
  <li>Fresh Brains</li>
 </ul>
 </details>
