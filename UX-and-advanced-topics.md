# Understanding User Needs <a name = "chapter-1"></a>
## Interviews <a name = "chapter-1.1"></a>
  Interview is a useful way of gathering user inout but the data acquired is not as significant as those from the observation sessions because 1. the questions asked in the interview are biased by the assuptions of the quiestioner and 2. the answers are based on the recall of the participants and this is not accurate. It is useful for documenting participants/ beliefs.

## Organising Data <a name = "chapter-1.2"><'a>
  ### Affinity Diagrams 
  Good for structuring unstructured data collected and spot a pattern.
  ### Word clouds 
  Use the word cloud generator to see a pattern.
  ### Task Modelling
  Model user's journey along the way and look out for loops and breakdowns to identify ways of making a process more efficient. Customer Journey Maps are commonly used as a way to outline user's initial intent through acieving that intent. This method focuses more on the communication between the company and their users.
  ### Personas or Market Segments
  Isolate different observations into cluster and give each clister a personas can help the team focus on coding for a specific group of users instead of making something for everybody.
  Market segments can identify the size and fitness of a specific market target. This is provable unlike personas. This, however, does not tell you about user's behaviours or beliefs.
  * Do NOT make something for everybody. Save the segments of other possible porsonas to make a subsequent product for*
                                              
## Metrics/Telemetry <a name = "chapter-1.3"></a>
   If you are creating a replacement for an existing application or service, analyse the data about user's interactions for any potential bottlenecks or surprising abandonment. This can be done with the help of Sankey Diagrams.
    
## Other Inputs <a name = "chapter-1.4"></a>
   If the product being design is a replacement or an upgrade of an existing product, collect data on that product; interview its users to see what they love and hate about the experience of using it. Ask them what they wish it did but it doesn’t. You can also evaluate those competing products yourself, and form a matrix of functionality to compare what those future competitors offer.
## BXT model and alternatives <a name = "chapter-1.5"></a>
  Once the experience of users was looked at, now it's time to take a look at the business side of it. Is there a viable market? Is there a business model that will allow your company to take a share of this market? Finally, is the technology up to the task of delivering the user experience and business model? Business (B), experience (X), and technology (T) are all essential for a commercial product.
  
## Measurable Design Goals <a name = "chapter-1.6"></a>
  ### Formulating measurable design goals
  A good design goal is
  + Based in user research and market research data
  + Realistically achievable
  + Measurable in terms of user behaviour or atitude
  ### Scenarios/Jobs to Be Done
  Use scenarios to form a story and Jobs to Be Done is based on a more terse statement of user intent, environment and goals. Jobs to Be Done put a greater emphasis on a measurable outcome. Do not include any implementation at this phase.
  ### Emotions
  Include emotions in your description of the before and after state of your user base.
  
  
 # Exploring Solutions <a name = "chapter-2"></a>
   ## Brainstorming Techniques <a name = "chapter-2.1"></a>
   ### HMWs
   How Might We statements
   Inclusive design - choosing the most compelling solutions
   Lateral thinking
   ## Storyboarding <a name = "chapter-2.2"></a>
   Storyboarding every ideas you have including details of user's interaction with the design. Don't leave out any state in the sequence, even if it's jsut a transiion. Make sure to label and date the storyboard, STORY-SEQUENCE-DATE should be enough for this project.choose the stories that will deliver the most values and redraw a new one by focusing on all the positive aspects and mitigating all the negative aspects of the previous storyboards.
   ## Sketching UI <a name = "chapter-2.3"></a>
   Identify elements and sequence of user interface your user will require from the story frame. Using a template that apporximates the actual size of the device you're targeting, begin drawing the controls, labels, text, and media your user will ned to get value from your application.
   The goals at this phase are
   + Quickly explore if the screen can fit the elements the user will need
   + Verify that he storyboards still make sense when the user interface is the only visual representation of the system
   ## Information Architecture <a name = "chapter-2.4"></a>
   This looks for method of organising the information system in a way which is supportive of the goals of the system's users.
   ### Card sorting
   It is important to understand the logic of your target user. One way to do this is by writing out a card for each major set of functions your application will perform and invite users from your target market to organise them in the most logical way. An example online tool [optimalworkshop.com](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/)
   ### Site Map
   Based on the user's way of organisation. it is a chart or a numbered list of the hierarchical groupings established by your card sort.
   ### Navigation controls
   Not all functions of the system need to be displayed at all times. Navigation controls allow your user to
   1. Know where they are in the information system
   2. Know what functions are available in the current location in the system
   3. Know how to get to other parts of the system
   ### System Design
   Even though you’re not done designing the user interface, you can begin documenting the system from the user’s point of view. For each major task your system will do, create a list of functions, data inputs, and data displays which will be necessary to support that task. On multi-disciplinary teams, this collection of data i/o, sequences, and linkages between functional areas can save a lot of time and ensure a design is implemented thoroughly.
  ## Layout/Composition <a name = "chapter-2.5"></a>
  For inspiration to keep trying on the graphic design taking to heart [Ira Glass' advice](https://vimeo.com/85040589)
  
  One simplest layout moethod to work with on computer is a grid system. This is common in Swiss design. Breaking the grid is an advanced technique; if too many elements break the grid, the grid disappears.
  
  If you’re beginning, we recommend choosing a simple grid, certainly no more than 12 columns, and it will be easier to convey order with fewer columns. If you do place an object off of the 4 column grid, consider placing it within an 8 column or 12 column grid to preserve the communication of order.
  
  If your user is remote, you can look up the device size online. A fun and comprehensive list can be found [here](http://screensiz.es/).
 
 ## Graphc Design Foundations
 ### Page Templates 
 This will be helpful if the apllication will be used across different device.
 
 ### Sample Application
 This needs a start screen, map screen and text messaging screen.
 
 ### Component templates
Look in your UI sketches for collections of text and imagery which might form a unit which could be repeated throughout your application. From the illustrations above, the treatment of the avatar and name above the most recent message in the Skype application is a repeating component. The treatment of the ¼ page width tile on the XBOX page is another example of a repeating component. By defining the layout of specific components, you can save time later by describing pages as collections of components. This will speed up prototyping and eventual coding.
  
### Visual Hierarchy
Information needs to be organized in such a way as to
+ Clearly indicate the way the information is organised
+ Draw the user’s attention to the most important information

### Typography
Typefaces convey more than the textual concepts referred to by the words. Selection of typefaces will have an impact on the message you’re communicating.

### Type ramp
Define a type ramp as a series of styles and stick with it. You may find later that you want to make one font larger or smaller; resist the urge. Users will infer meaning from the size and placement of type so ensure your type choices are all in support of conveying the information hierarchy. The type ramp should define a series of information functions and assign a type treatment to it. Information functions could include titles, headings, subheadings, links, captions, and body text. You’ll know what to include from your UI sketches.

## Wireframing <a name = "chapter-2.6"></a>
Wireframes are a good time to go digital with your design, but our goal in wireframing is to stay away from color and final visual finish. This allows us to focus on the information hierarchy and visual hierarchy as conveyed by layout grid and the type ramp. When we can get our application to convey accurate meaning at the wireframe level, then the visual finish phase can focus on conveying emotion without having confounding variables at the function and meaning level.

Popular wireframing applications on Windows include Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Visio, and Balsamiq. Popular wireframing tools on the Macintosh OS include Omnigraffle, Adobe Illustrator, Balsamiq, and Sketch. A popular cross platform tool would be HTML and CSS.

There is some controversy about this; some current practitioners skip wireframing, arguing there simply isn’t time in the development cycle. Our counterargument to this is that it shouldn’t take much time, and the things you can learn from a wireframe will improve your final visual design. Take what you’ve learned from your UI sketching and iterate on it in a digital tool to come up with a wireframe.
  
## Flow Charting <a name = "chapter-2.7"></a>
Map out the sequence of how the user will interact with the application. You can be as detailed as you need to represent what the application needs to accomplish. We’d advise staying away from defining details of the technical implementation until your idea has benefitted from usability testing. The flow chart is useful in communicating the full extent of your design idea, since it shows all of the choices the user needs to be able to make in the application at a glance.
  
    
## Prototyping <a name = "chapter-2.8"></a>
The purpose of prototyping is to answer a question about an interaction pattern or layout issue. The prototype exists as a stimulus in an experiment that will answer a research question. Although you can make a pixel-perfect fully functional prototype, chances are the return on investment for this level of fidelity won’t be as high as if you were to focus your prototyping effort on specific interactions which you’re not certain users will understand. The fidelity of your prototype depends not only on your research question, but also on the test protocol. An unmoderated test often benefits from a more fully implemented prototype since a researcher won’t be on hand to explain any unimplemented features or bugs.

# Calibrating the Design <a name = "chapter-3"></a>
## User testing protocols <a name = "chapter-3.1"></a>
This phase of the design is to answer any questions you have about an application's functionality or effect on user behaviour or attitude. The protocols needed depend on the nature of the questions. *Make sure you have participant's consent before any recording.*

## Assessing the data you’ve collected <a name = "chapter-3.2"></a>
Recording detailed notes with partipicant ID nad sequence number. If number of participants is large, you can look for a pattern.

## Issues matrix <a name = "chapter-3.3"></a>
A matrix that is useful in assessing data collected. It is done by listing the problems user encounter along one dimension and users who encountered them on another one. Tis help pointing out outliers and unique participants for further research.

## Update wireframes and prototypes <a name = "chapter-3.4"></a>
As you uncover issues which are likely to be barriers to user success with your application, you must re-enter a design phase to design a solution to the problems. Make sure to preserve what was working about the application, which is why it is important in your research rounds to note what is working. As you advance through the design phase, the types of changes you can incorporate without destabilizing the success of the earlier iterations of the design. Plan to continue testing each iteration to ensure that your changes are making progress towards upholding your goals instead of regressing from your goals. Update your prototypes while increasing the fidelity of the design. It is important for the design team to recognize how the scope of potential changes to the application must diminish to preserve the successes of earlier iterations. The time for wild changes to the application concept is most convenient at the very beginning of the process. Iteration over iteration, the amplitude of change which can be successfully incorporated without jeopardizing earlier success must diminish. 

# Finishing the Design <a name = "chapter-4"></a>
  ## Branding <a name = "chapter-4.1"></a>
  In a digital application, brand is communicated in color, sound, editorial tone, motion, and the reliability of the functionality provided. In modern application distribution points, brand is also strongly influenced by user reviews of the application.
  
  To have a credible brand, the attributes you aspire to should emerge from a profound sense of why you’re doing the work at all. We admire Simon Sinek’s work in the area of establishing credible brand propositions by starting with why. Ask why the work is important, then ask why that answer is important, then do it three more times. This method of asking “why is this important” five times can help you get to an enduring central truth about your motivation. Arising from that central motivation, you can develop an enduring brand.
  
  ### Mood Boards
  Mood boards can be used as stimuli in focus groups to understand if the aspirational adjectives of the brand are what participants use to describe the imagery. We recommend reading Joey Benedeck and Trish Miner’s paper on the Desirability Toolkit as a useful method of assessing alignment with brand aspirational qualities. High quality design efforts will create several of these mood boards to find the imagery which best communicates a set of brand attributes.
  
  ## Colour <a name = "chapter-4.2"></a>
  The colour palette is developed after an effective mood board is reached. The more colors you have in your palette, the harder it will be to establish a sense of cohesiveness in the design. An important consideration for color selection is accessibility. Not everybody has the same visual capabilities. Many potential users of your application will not be capable of differentiating between two colors with similar luminosity. There are several excellent online tools which can measure the difference in contrast (luminosity) between two colors. The Worldwide Web Content Accessibility Group maintains recommendations. The 2.0 standard for contrast between foreground text and background is 4.5:1 for fonts smaller than 18pts.
  
  ## Images <a name = "chapter-4.3"></a>
  Not all applications present imagery, but the choice of photography, illustrations, and iconography will either uphold or degrade a brand. Using a consistent point of view when selecting and composing imagery will go a long way towards upholding a brand.
  
  Color or black and white? What are the common attributes of the subjects of the photos? What are the common compositional traits? What are the common aspect ratios of the photo collection? Are there common filters or focusing techniques applied? Are the photos framed with any type of matte treatment? What is the white space surrounding the photos? Don’t leave any of these attributes of the photos to chance. Find a global brand you are aware of online. Notice what commonalities their photography has. If you choose photography to be presented by your application, pay attention to all these questions and make certain your answers are intentional and consistent with your brand aspiration.
  
  ### Illustration
  Icons can help frequent users of an application rapidly identify a function. In order to have your users accept your icons, it is important that they are of a consistent style and also in support of the color palette. If your icons don’t utilize similar visual conventions, including line weight, line style, presence or absence of lighting, and color, then your users will have lower trust in the quality of your application.
  
  Do the angles seem related? Do the line widths seem intentional? Do the icons function well at scale in the application? Are users more effective when the icons are in the application? Do they support a brand color palette? Ask these questions of your own designs and see if you can improve them.
  
  ## Motion <a name = "chapter-4.4"></a>
  Humans will attribute an emotion to the motion. Is the motion soothing? Is it playful? Is it aggressive? Is it a drain on user focus?
  
  Motion in micro-interactions can convey a sense of the application’s brand. Motion can also play a part in information hierarchy. If a user drilling down into a subcategory sees information sliding in from the right, choosing to the slide the information back to the right when they navigate to the parent node in the hierarchy will reinforce the sense of special memory.

Motion can enhance a user’s understanding of how your application stores information, particularly with full screen transitions. If you use Windows, note the motion initiated when you click on the Windows Start menu. Notice how the layout moves into place quickly then slowly. If you use a Mac computer, notice the motion when you choose “Get Info” on any file or folder in the Finder. Notice how the motion is reversed when you close the info panel, drawing the user’s attention back towards the object which spawned the window in the first place.

Judicious use of motion can enhance the brand impression of your application. Too much animation might make your users feel uncomfortable. If you’re designing a system for users who will be using the application repeatedly, ensure that the motion doesn’t slow them down.

  ## Copy <a name = "chapter-4.5"></a>
  As mentioned earlier, the words you use in your application (the copy) can either support or suppress your brand impression. Be deliberate in how you phrase error messages, warnings, alerts, and explanatory text. The editorial tone of the copy should align with the brand of your application. Also consider how the tone might be interpreted by the user; a playful or flippant tone might be interpreted as insensitivity if it is used to convey a message about an unrecoverable destruction of user data. If you’re coding an application for multiple languages, there is no substitute for engaging the services of a native speaker who can ensure that the brand proposition is properly supported in their language. Many products offer multiple language support through machine translation, but for that to be successful it is important that the source language be relatively free of colloquialisms and idiosyncrasies; the very aspects of language that do the most in conveying tone. Copy which is written for machine translation will be perceived as stiff and staid. If those are not amongst your aspirational brand attributes, then that’s a tradeoff you should be aware of.

Error messages should always describe what the user can do to recover from the error condition. Without that, users are likely to become frustrated with your application.

  ## Whitespace/content balance/clarity <a name = "chapter-4.6"></a>
  The greater density of information in your layout, the more likely your user’s first reaction will be to complexity. High density information displays are more complicated to make sense out of. In light use consumer applications, you might not be able to get away with any less than 50% white space. In resident applications, a term coined by Alan Cooper for applications which the user will be using for hours every workday, the tradeoff of whitespace for increased productivity may be worth it. In general expert users have a far greater tolerance for complexity and information density, because they have already spent hours and hours with the application to build that expertise. Whether or not you design for a beginner or an expert or somewhere in between should be central and primary deliverable of your user research phase. Beginners in general will have low to no tolerance for complexity, either conceptually or visually.
  
  Whitespace can be a powerful compositional element. Even if you’re not aware of it, it can be informing your pre-cognitive impression of order or disorder. Leading (line-height in css) can greatly affect the readability of blocks of text. Greater leading will allow more white space to come through the pixels. Generous margins can help people feel less cramped when perceiving your layout. Generous amounts of whitespace also is common among luxury brands, perhaps because the generosity of space is assumed to be coming from a publisher with abundance. They don’t need to cram a bunch of information onto the layout.
  
  Keep in mind that every time you add a bounding box or horizontal rules or colored background, you’re paying for it with whitespace. Try a variant of the design which uses whitespace alone to group content and communicate order, then see if it is more effective at supporting the brand aspiration and the communication goals of the application than the layout boxes and lines.
  
  ## Visual Hierarchy and how the eye accepts information  <a name = "chapter-4.7"></a>
  Our sense of visual hierarchy is most likely informed by our first written language. The reading order of the language, be it left to right, right to left, or top to bottom, will inform our way of making sense of information. The letter forms or script we first learned most likely inform our preferred method of effective communication. Our life experiences reading, and conventions we’ve learned from books, magazines, and newspapers will all inform our expectations for order in design
  
  What is the purpose of the designed screen? What is the main point of the design? If the design includes additional information, how does it relate to the main point? What is the core message you want users to take away? What is the main call to action you want your users to take? A good design will communicate all of this within half a second by relying on the grouping of information formed by whitespace, layout grid, and typography. Users will scan for all of these clues over the entire layout before even reading a single word.
  
  Iterate on the design until you’re certain that users will infer the right idea about the organization of the information before they read anything.
  
  ## Common “visual affordances”  <a name = "chapter-4.8"></a>
  Definition - an “affordance” affords a user of a design some value.
  
  If you have a choice between an existing pattern and a new pattern that is just as good as an existing pattern, choose the existing pattern. The only reason to use a new pattern is if it performs much better than the existing pattern. To paraphrase one of the design principles for Windows 8, “change is bad, unless it’s great”.
  
  ## UI Design Trends and Best Practices <a name = "chapter-4.9"></a>
  UI design trends tend to come and go, like fashion. Just like fashion, people will expect that you’re aware of these trends. What isn’t changing is the conversation between the design and the user.
  
  Early success with these real-world metaphors led to a design philosophy of emulating the physical world for metaphors in computing. If a container could be rendered as a folder, we could render a collection of reading material as a bookshelf. If an audio experience was based on cassette or reel-to-reel tape, then mimicking the play, pause, and fast forward buttons might make working with a digital music player easier to understand. This trend of emulating the physical world is called skeumorphism, and it was the dominant trend in GUI design for computers for years.
  
  ## Validating the finished design <a name = "chapter-4.10"></a>
  When you’ve completed applying the visual finish to the design, it is important to go back to your users again and verify if the design still accomplishes the goals you set out to achieve. You’re validating that the choices you made in the final visual finish stage didn’t have a negative effect on user performance. This is your last sanity check before investing in real code, so don’t skip it only to discover a more expensive problem later.
  
  ## Documenting the finished design <a name = "chapter-4.11"></a>
  If you’re co-located with your engineering team, and your prototype is high fidelity, the design can be explained in a presentation. Make sure all engineers coding the interface can attend and cover every interaction leaving room for questions. Ideally, they would have seen your design as it was evolving to ensure you don’t design something truly impossible.
  
  If your team is not located with you, or if they can’t meet, then you’re going to need to document the design. Your engineers will need to know precisely what each measurement, color, typeface, and interaction will be so that they can create performant, secure, scalable code out of it. There are several tools on the market today that can help with this, including InVision and Zepplin.io, and there are probably great new competitors every week. If you can’t use one of these tools, then Sketch is a popular user experience design tool which offers plug-ins which can help with automating at least a portion of the measurement documentation. If you can’t use Sketch, Adobe Illustrator can produce beautiful design documentation. Anything that isn’t documented, including interactions, is unlikely to get built. Even with great documentation, it is important to lead your engineering team through an end-to-end walkthrough of the design, which can be accomplished in a slide deck or a video.
  
  ### Testing the design throughout development
  As the application you’ve designed is built, it is important to monitor the progress to ensure fidelity to the original design. Often there are confounding obstacles during engineering that might force your team to alter the implementation of the design. If you don’t track the progress, you might never know about these alterations. Make sure that the build is regularly tested with users, using the same testing protocol as you used for your final design stage usability test. If you find changes to the design which prohibit the users from accomplishing their goal, or diminish the application’s effectiveness in anyway, bring them to the design team immediately to report the data and collaborate to find a feasible fix.
  
  ### Collecting and analyzing telemetry on the released design
  Plan to track what your users are doing with your released application. This will give you some insights into which functions are in highest demand, and may uncover workflows which seem to be diminishing user success. Look for indication of interaction loops. If users are interacting between multiple screens in what seems to be a loop, look into those screens to understand what might be confusing users. If necessary plan for a moderated usability study to uncover issues with these screens you hadn’t seen before releasing. Look for pogo-stick patterns, wherein a user jumps down a level in the information architecture and then goes back up again. This might suggest the labels for the next layer of the information are confusing. Binary applications have complete control over what gets logged. Tools like Adobe Experience Manager can help applications collect and analyze usage patterns from large pools of data.
  
  The key is knowing that your release date is just the beginning. Your goal is impacting user’s lives, and you won’t know that until you can detect the usage patterns. It can be tempting to want to track every little thing, but unless you’re willing to make a significant investment in coding a reporting system, or a sizable investment in altering the way your application stores logging information so that it might be possible to port it into an analytics reporting tool, then it might be best to start small. Track a few things that your team believes are critical to success and make sure you can report on them. If you have further questions about user behavior which your current stats don’t tell you, then add logging in over time. Telemetric data which isn’t used is a waste of engineering time and electricity; don’t track things you don’t use, and make sure you act on the data you’ve collected to drive improvements in user success.
