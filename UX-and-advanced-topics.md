# Understanding User Needs <a name = "chapter-1"></a>
## Interviews <a name = "chapter-1.1"></a>
Interview is a useful way of gathering user inout but the data acquired is not as significant as those from the observation sessions because 1. the questions asked in the interview are biased by the assuptions of the quiestioner and 2. the answers are based on the recall of the participants and this is not accurate. It is useful for documenting participants/ beliefs.

## Organising Data <a name = "chapter-1.2"><'a>
  ### Affinity Diagrams 
    Good for structuring unstructured data collected and spot a pattern.
  ### Word clouds 
    USe the word cloud generator to see a pattern.
  ### Task Modelling
    Model user's journey along the way and look out for loops and breakdowns to identify ways of making a process more efficient. Customer Journey Maps are commonly used as a way to outline user's initial intent through acieving that intent. This method focuses more on the communication between the company and their users.
  ### Personas or Market Segments
      Isolate different observations into cluster and give each clister a personas can help the team focus on coding for a specific group of users instead of making something for everybody.
      Market segments can identify the size and fitness of a specific market target. This is provable unlike personas. This, however, does not tell you about user's behaviours or beliefs.
      * Do NOT make something for everybody. Save the segments of other possible porsonas to make a subsequent product for*
                                              
## Metrics/Telemetry <a name = "chapter-1.3"></a>
    If you are creating a replacement for an existing application or service, analyse the data about user's interactions for any potential bottlenecks or surprising abandonment. This can be done with the help of Sankey Diagrams.
    
## Other Inputs <a name = "chapter-1.4"></a>
    If the product being design is a replacement or an upgrade of an existing product, collect data on that product; interview its users to see what they love and hate about the experience of using it. Ask them what they wish it did but it doesn’t. You can also evaluate those competing products yourself, and form a matrix of functionality to compare what those future competitors offer.
## BXT model and alternatives <a name = "chapter-1.5"></a>
  Once the experience of users was looked at, now it's time to take a look at the business side of it. Is there a viable market? Is there a business model that will allow your company to take a share of this market? Finally, is the technology up to the task of delivering the user experience and business model? Business (B), experience (X), and technology (T) are all essential for a commercial product.
  
## Measurable Design Goals <a name = "chapter-1.6"></a>
  ### Formulating measurable design goals
  A good design goal is
  + Based in user research and market research data
  + Realistically achievable
  + Measurable in terms of user behaviour or atitude
  ### Scenarios/Jobs to Be Done
  Use scenarios to form a story and Jobs to Be Done is based on a more terse statement of user intent, environment and goals. Jobs to Be Done put a greater emphasis on a measurable outcome. Do not include any implementation at this phase.
  ### Emotions
  Include emotions in your description of the before and after state of your user base.
  
  
 # Exploring Solutions <a name = "chapter-2"></a>
   ## Brainstorming Techniques <a name = "chapter-2.1"></a>
   ### HMWs
   How Might We statements
   Inclusive design - choosing the most compelling solutions
   Lateral thinking
   ## Storyboarding <a name = "chapter-2.2"></a>
   Storyboarding every ideas you have including details of user's interaction with the design. Don't leave out any state in the sequence, even if it's jsut a transiion. Make sure to label and date the storyboard, STORY-SEQUENCE-DATE should be enough for this project.choose the stories that will deliver the most values and redraw a new one by focusing on all the positive aspects and mitigating all the negative aspects of the previous storyboards.
   ## Sketching UI <a name = "chapter-2.3"></a>
   Identify elements and sequence of user interface your user will require from the story frame. Using a template that apporximates the actual size of the device you're targeting, begin drawing the controls, labels, text, and media your user will ned to get value from your application.
   The goals at this phase are
   + Quickly explore if the screen can fit the elements the user will need
   + Verify that he storyboards still make sense when the user interface is the only visual representation of the system
   ## Information Architecture <a name = "chapter-2.4"></a>
   This looks for method of organising the information system in a way which is supportive of the goals of the system's users.
   ### Card sorting
   It is important to understand the logic of your target user. One way to do this is by writing out a card for each major set of functions your application will perform and invite users from your target market to organise them in the most logical way. An example online tool [optimalworkshop.com](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/)
   ### Site Map
   Based on the user's way of organisation. it is a chart or a numbered list of the hierarchical groupings established by your card sort.
   ### Navigation controls
   Not all functions of the system need to be displayed at all times. Navigation controls allow your user to
   1. Know where they are in the information system
   2. Know what functions are available in the current location in the system
   3. Know how to get to other parts of the system
   ### System Design
   Even though you’re not done designing the user interface, you can begin documenting the system from the user’s point of view. For each major task your system will do, create a list of functions, data inputs, and data displays which will be necessary to support that task. On multi-disciplinary teams, this collection of data i/o, sequences, and linkages between functional areas can save a lot of time and ensure a design is implemented thoroughly.
  ## Layout/Composition <a name = "chapter-2.5"></a>
  For inspiration to keep trying on the graphic design taking to heart [Ira Glass' advice](https://vimeo.com/85040589)
  
  One simplest layout moethod to work with on computer is a grid system. This is common in Swiss design. Breaking the grid is an advanced technique; if too many elements break the grid, the grid disappears.
  
  If you’re beginning, we recommend choosing a simple grid, certainly no more than 12 columns, and it will be easier to convey order with fewer columns. If you do place an object off of the 4 column grid, consider placing it within an 8 column or 12 column grid to preserve the communication of order.
  
  If your user is remote, you can look up the device size online. A fun and comprehensive list can be found [here](http://screensiz.es/).
